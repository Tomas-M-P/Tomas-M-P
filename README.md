ðŸ‘‹ Hi, IÂ´m Tomas Ortega a Scientist & Entrepreneur with a background in founding and leading companies in the fields of Biotechnology. 
I have a background in providing guidance to entrepreneurs and startups, focusing on areas like business models, commercial strategies, intellectual property, scaling, and fundraising.
Additionally, I've designed and executed innovation programs across different environments, from startups to academic institutions, aimed at enhancing capabilities and fostering impactful innovations.
Currently, I am dedicated to driving the development and growth of science and technology-based startups.
Along this path, I have recognized the urgent need to democratize and decentralize science to create globally impactful innovations.
My main goal is to ensure that science advances at the same pace as society, so that scientific and technological innovations directly impact the lives of millions of people.
To achieve this, we need to transform the paradigm of science funding, allowing new players to invest in the science of the future.
In this journey, technologies like Blockchain offer unique advantages in terms of decentralization, security, reliability, and agility in scientific and technological investment.
If you share my vision of promoting science and technology-based entrepreneurship as a driver of economic, social, and environmental development, 
I would be delighted to connect and explore shared experiences and challenges.
